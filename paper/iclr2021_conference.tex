We perform end-to-end model-based learning of dynamical systems.
We use a Neural ODE to model system dynamics, and direct multpile shooting methods
to select an optimal policy. We train the Neural ODE by using the IFT to propagate
gradient information through the KKT conditions of the optimization problem.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the classical cartpole swing-upper
and Van der Pol domains, as well as in the Tumour Anti-angiogenesis model proposed
by Ledzewicz and Sch√§ttler (ref). In bla domains, our approach outperforms/underperforms
the standard MLE approach.

\section{Introduction}

We are interested in continuous-state continuous-time domains where the system dynamics
are described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The stardard approaches in these
settings come from optimal control theory, and include direct methods such as multilple
shooting and collocation, and indirect methods such as (forward-backward sweep?).
Of course, the application of these optimal
control methods requires access to the equations describing the system dynamics.

In settings where the system dynamics are unknown, RL techniques use a reward signal to
learn how to behave optimally. Model-free RL, in which a policy is learned more or less directly,
has shown strong performance across many domains. However, model-free RL usually requires
a large number of training epsodes to perform well, and might have difficulty generalizing.
Model-based RL but is difficult because (why is it difficult), but offers better sample complexity
and generalization.

Previous work has merged elements of optimal control and machine learning, such as including 
an ODE solver in a neural network (optnet), and using MPC in an RL setting (diff mpc). (talk a
but more about what's already been done)

Like diff mpc, we use techniques from optimal control to select actions based on a model which
approximates the dynamics of the environment. Unlike diff mpc, we do not restrict ourselves to 
quadratic cost function, instead allowing application. (talk more about how we're different from
diff mpc)

\section{Background}

Does anyone feel like writing this section? :p
I think we need to talk about what other people have done.

\section{End-to-end learning}

Our end-to-end learning routine is based on two intercorrected pieces:
solution of the optimal control problem by direct multiple shooting, and
propagation of the gradient information to train the neural ODE.

\subsection{Direct multiple shooting}

Direct multiple shooting is a direct method for solving optimal control problems.
It works by discretizing the problem at a number of \emph{knot points}, and then
performing numerical integration between the knot points. The problem is solved 
as a non-linear program (NLP), using some cost (which in general may be nonlinear),
subject to constraints imposed by the dynamics at the knot points, as well as 
bounds on the control and state values.

An optimal control problem is defined as:

\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} \quad &\int_0^T c(x, u, t) \; dt \\
\text{subject to} \quad &g(x, u) \leq 0 \\
\text{and} \quad &h(x, u) = 0,
\end{align*}

where $c$ is an instantaneous cost function, and $g$ and $h$ are
constraint functions on the states and parameters.

In the case of direct multiple shooting, we discretize the problem into
$N$ shooting intervals, evenly spaced between $0$ and $T$. Furthermore,
we divide each shooting interval into $K$ timesteps. In this way, the
control function that we're trying to learn is discretized as $u_{0:N \cdot K-1}$, and we
perform zero-order interpolation to recover the function.

The decision variables in the resulting NLP are $u_{0:N \cdot K-1}$ and $x_{1:N}$.
They must satisfy the following equalities:

\begin{equation*}
\varphi(x_i, u_{(i-1)\cdot K:i \cdot K - 1}, t) = x_{i+1} \quad \text{for } i=1, \ldots, N
\end{equation*}
where $\varphi(a, b, t)$ is a function which starts in state $a$ and applies vector of controls $b$
to integrate forwards.

(will need to have more here. perhaps a diagram?)

\subsection{Neural ode}

Neural ODE is the idea of using a neural network to learn differential system dynamics.
Traditionally, Neural ODE is trained using the imitation loss from trajectories
which are sampled from the true system dynamics. Trajectories are generated from the
Neural ODE by using a numerical integration technique, such as 4th order Runge Kutta.
The gradient of the loss is calculated by backpropagating through the numerical integration.
This can be done using either the discrete or continuous adjoint methods, each of which
has their advantages. For now, we use the discrete method, which amounts to AD.

Say we have some $f_{\theta}$ which is a dynamics-approximating neural network paramatrized by $\theta$. We want to train it to match the true dynamics $f$.

Say we are given a control function $u$, a starting state $x_0$, and an ending time $T$. Given two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$, we define their "difference" as:

\begin{equation*}
\| \phi(f_1, x_0, u) - \phi(f_2, x_0, u)\|_{L^2, [0,T]},
\end{equation*}

where $\| \bullet \|_{L^2, [0, T]}$ denotes the $L^2$ norm, with $\phi$ resticted to the domain $[0, T]$.

We want to find $\theta$ to minimize the difference between $f$ and $f_{\theta}$. In other words, we want:

\begin{equation*}
\arg \min_{\theta} \| \phi(f, x_0, u) - \phi(f_{\theta}, x_0, u)\|_{L^2, [0,T]}.
\end{equation*}

We can do this by performing gradient descent on $\theta$, with an update step like

\begin{equation*}
\theta \gets \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \| \phi(f, x_0, u) - \phi(f_{\theta}, x_0, u)\|_{L^2, [0,T]},
\end{equation*}

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

\subsection{end-to-end learning}
Let us have some system dynamics $f$, a start state $x_0$, and a final time $T$.

Say there is a control function $v$ that we want to imitate. We can define how far a control function $u$ is from $v$ by defining the loss:

\begin{equation*}
J(f, v, u, x_0, T) = \| \phi(f, x_0, v) - \phi(f, x_0, u)\|_{L^2, [0,T]}.
\end{equation*}

Now we want to combine the two problems: simultaneously learn a model $f_{\theta} \approx f$ and learn an optimal control function $u^{\star}(f, c, x_0, T)$ (in practice we'll learn $u_{0:T,h}^{\star}(f, c, x_0, T)$). Assume we have some optimal controller which gives us a control function $v$. Then we do this using the following algorithm

\begin{align*}
& \text{initialize } \theta \\
& \text{do until $\theta$ stops changing:} \\
& \quad u_{0:T,h} \gets \arg \min_{u_{0:T,h}} C(\phi(f_{\theta}, x_0, g_h(u_{0:T,h})), g_h(u_{0:T,h}), T) \qquad (1) \\
& \quad \theta \gets \theta - \eta \nabla_{\theta}J(f, v, g_h(u_{0:T,h}), x_0, T) \qquad (2) \\
\end{align*}

where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
with no indentation.

Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

Authors' names are
set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
same address can be on the same line.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


There will be a strict upper limit of 8 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. Note that the upper page limit differs from last year!Authors may use as many pages of appendices (after the bibliography) as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. During the rebuttal phase and for the camera ready version, authors are allowed one additional page for the main text, for a strict upper limit of 9 pages.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

First level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
%\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
\end{center}
\caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample table title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}

Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
(especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+
from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
or % Apr 2009 addition
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
for .pdf graphics.
See section~4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.

\subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
If you'd like to, you may include  a section for author contributions as is done
in many journals. This is optional and at the discretion of the authors.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.
